All wifi, HIGHLY RECOMMEND BUYING IT</span> <span> Reviewed in the United States on October 27, 2019</span> <span> Verified Purchase</span> <span> <span> If you are looking for an affordable and portable Projector, this one is it. Best picture I've seen from all the projectors I've tried. Best part of it is the wireless connections. Phone, MacBook, iPad or any device you can connect wirelessly. I had all 3 of my devices connected to the projector and was able to switch from one to another effortlessly. We had a movie night with this thing and surprisingly enough the sound coming out of the projector is pretty good. I didn't have to connect any external speakers but i could have easily with the audio cord it comes with. I have a tripod and easily put it on and it made it so easy to move back and forth where i needed it. The PICTURE is INCREDIBLE. Considering I have tan walls I can imagine what a white wall would make it so much brighter. I am ordering a screen so I can play in the back yard and have movie nights with neighbors. Maybe I'll charge admission. HEHE!!<br/> So to sum it up, QUALITY, AFFORDABILITY, PORTABLE, EXCELLENT PICTURE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY IS THE WIFI CONNECTION. No need for any wires/cables. I love this thing and I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND BUYING IT. YOU WONT REGRET IT. </span> <i> </i> <span> Read more</span> </span> <span> <i> </i> </span> <span> <span> 187 people found this helpful</span> <span> <span> Helpful </span> </span> </span> <i> </i> Comment <span> <span> <i> </i> <span> Report abuse </span> </span> </span> <span> erin</span> <i> <span> 5.0 out of 5 stars</span> </i> <span> </span> <span> 5/5 STAR's so happy with this product!</span> <span> Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2020</span> <span> Size: 12.8 x 8.6 x 4.7 inches</span> <i> </i> <span> Verified Purchase</span> <span> <span> This is EXACTLY what i was looking for!

Many of the models at this price only support 480p natively, meaning there will be a lot of downscaling when connected to most modern computers or streaming devices, which natively output at 720p or higher. This projector however supports 720p natively, giving you a much sharper and clearer picture. Although it can support up to 1080p, I think things look a little sharper at 720p on it. In addition, the front facing speaker helps deliver loud and clear sound, and the 3.5mm out port and included 3.5mm-to-LR adaptor gives it a broader compatibility with other budget sound setups.<br/> <br/> What I really like about this projector isn't the resolution or the speaker, but the portability. It's small and light, and with the included padded carrying case it's easy to take anywhere. It boots up very quickly with almost no warm up time, it's straightforward to use, and it doesn't run too hot. With it's small size and included carrying case, it's perfect for taking to meetings whenever you need to give a presentation, or when you want to take it outside or to a friend's house for movie night.<br/> <br/> The downside of this projector though is the relatively short power cord it comes with. If you're going for a premium home theatre setup, the power cord will limit where you can place the projector, and you may be better off with a top of the line BenQ projector which supports higher resolution at a price of over $500. The entry level BenQ projectors can even go for almost $300 without being able to support 720p natively. But for something affordable that you can set up quickly, such as for the occasional outdoor movie nights or for presentations, where you'll likely have powerstrips or outlets nearby, this projector is ideal.<br/> <br/> Overall 4/5. It can't be beat for the price if you're looking for a balance between quality and portability. For a permanent and premium home theatre setup, you'll get more from some other projectors but at a much higher cost. </span> <i> </i> <span> Read more</span> </span> <span> <span> 63 people found this helpful</span> <span> <span> Helpful </span> </span> </span> <i> </i> Comment <span> <span> <i> </i> <span> Report abuse </span> </span> </span> <span> Karissa D.</span> <i> <span> 5.0 out of 5 stars</span> </i> <span> </span> <span> Amazing & compact!</span> <span> Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2020</span> <span> Verified Purchase</span> <span> Your browser does not support HTML5 video. <span> This projector is amazing! Being in a school where the Smartboard does not work, this projector allows me to meet the needs of my students. Showing movies and presenting lessons have a clear quality. The sound is just a bit low, but with a bluetooth speaker and/or using an Aux chord definitely enhances the sound. I plan on using this at home too especially on nice summer days! Definitely recommend this product! </span> <i> </i> <span> Read more</span> </span> <span> <i> </i> </span> <span> <span> 117 people found this helpful</span> <span> <span> Helpful </span> </span> </span> <i> </i> Comment <span> <span> <i> </i> <span> Report abuse </span> </span> </span> <span> Andres</span> <span> <span> </span> <span> VINE VOICE</span> </span> <i> <span> 5.0 out of 5 stars</span> </i> <span> </span> <span> Small and Lightweight</span> <span> Reviewed in the United States on May 9, 2019</span> <span> Verified Purchase</span> <span> <span> This product is a great entry-level projector that provides a good resolution with a low cost. The carrying case comes with two different audio cables (AV + HDMI), a remote (without any batteries), a manual, and a screw to increase the incline of the projector. As others have mentioned, the included power cable is on the shorter side, however this was no issue for me as I already needed a longer extension cord in order to charge my laptop outside. I've only used the product outside due to space limitations inside, however you could decrease the distance and lower the zoom in order to display it on a smaller screen.<br/> <br/> In regards to set-up, the projector turns on quickly with very little warm up time. The projector also shuts off quickly (double press the power button) and can be put away without having to wait 15 seconds for it to shut off. The speakers on the projector are good, however they are not too loud especially if used for outside viewing (due to cars driving by). I would definitely recommend using external speakers in that scenario. If you are having issues with getting the right size on a screen, the remote can be used to quickly go into settings to change the scaling. </span> <i> </i> <span> Read more</span> </span> <span> <i> </i> </span> <span> <span> 47 people found this helpful</span> <span> <span> Helpful </span> </span> </span> <i> </i> Comment <span> <span> <i> </i> <span> Report abuse </span> </span> </span> See all reviews </span> <span> <span> <h3> Top reviews from other countries </h3> <span> Translate all reviews to English </span> <span> Matt</span> <i> <span> 5.0 out of 5 stars</span> </i> <span> </span> <span> <span> smart shopping</span> </span> <span> Reviewed in Australia on March 3, 2020</span> <span> Verified Purchase</span> <span> <span> I've been using this on a day to day basis for the last 1 month and it's worked well. I have it hooked up to my X-box one, and a Bose sound touch speaker (by way of an aux cable, the blue tooth has just good performance that's bare, for gaming becomes very apparent). At first, the picture comes in a bit "juicy" meaning the colours can seem a bit saturated, but that was easily fixed through modifying some colour and brightness levels through the main menu, and engineers menu (see manual). Whites still come in super bright, but at $290 it's kind of a minor thing. Like most projectors, it works best in darker environments. I like to use mine in low lighting just because it gets depressing sitting in a super dark room all the time, and I still get good performance out of it. Again, at this price, it's been a real bargain and has already outperformed other "cheap option" projectors I've tried. It probably won't ever be as crisp as a 4k TV, but it's been fun to play games and watch movies on. I would say you could safely give this a shot. </span> <i> </i> <span> Read more</span> </span> <span> <span> 3 people found this helpful</span> </span> <span> <span> <span> Report abuse </span> </span> </span> <span> Kayla Luo</span> <i> <span> 5.0 out of 5 stars</span> </i> <span> </span> <span> <span> recommended</span> </span> <span> Reviewed in Australia on October 12, 2019</span> <span> Verified Purchase</span> <span> Your browser does not support HTML5 video. <span> It's amazing!

It’s hard to show you the quality of product on a picture but trust my words, this is one of the best projects i’ve got(i’ve got 5 at home). The most important thing in projector for me is that it should have a good picture quality and this is the reason why i loved this project. I really like the quality of the videos and the fact that i can stream the video and games without using any cables. Mentioning about the cables - i super like that the company that sells this projector included an HDMI cable inside of the package for free! Also, i am surprised that it even has a controller, so that you don’t even need to stand up from the sofa to be able to control the projector 🥳<br/> <br/> I thought to buy a TV before and then realized that if i buy a projector i would double win because in case if i need to move out or leave the country, I won’t be able to take my tv with me but with tiny and powerful projector i can go anywhere i want and i will always have my movies with me 😊 Anyway, i would recommend to everyone this projector as it is a really product with a great quality! I SUPER LOVED IT ❤️ </span> <i> </i> <span> Read more</span> </span> <span> <span> One person found this helpful</span> </span> <span> <span> <span> Report abuse </span> </span> </span> <span> Paea</span> <i> <span> 5.0 out of 5 stars</span> </i> <span> </span> <span> <span> Loved the screen size and the quick and easy set up</span> </span> <span> Reviewed in Australia on November 28, 2019</span> <span> Verified Purchase</span> <span> <span> Basically plug in and connect your preferred device, point towards a spare wall and view. It's so simple to operate. There is an instruction manual to help with compatible devices and cords required. If you're able to set up your tv to devices to view, then this projector will be easy to set up too. No need to be too tech savvy.<br/> <br/> There is a speaker which is acceptable, although I will be investing in speakers in the future.<br/> <br/> I own a mini projector which wasn't a good buy so I was hesitant when I purchased this one.<br/> <br/> But this HD TV Projector is just perfect for home use and small gatherings or meetings. It performs as well as expensive projectors but it's small and compact and surprisingly light weight compared to other projectors. The carry bag is the perfect accessory and comes free.<br/> <br/> I found the big buttons on the projector perfect for navigating the on screen menu, a pleasant change to the usual small cheap buttons. The buttons were extremely responsive, there is also a remote.<br/> <br/> The screen size depends on how far the projector is to the wall/screen. Further away, larger screen. Closer, smaller screen. There is a lens adjust to sharpen a blurry picture, and another lens adjust the tilt.<br/> <br/> The fan noise isn't that noticeable. Its expected with projectors. It's no different to a computer tower so it's an acceptable and necessary noise.<br/> <br/> Overall this projector was a great buy and I'm really happy with its performance. Price is a nice bonus as it doesn't break the bank. Easy set up and I dont need a tech degree to operate. </span> <i> </i> <span> Read more</span> </span> <span> <span> One person found this helpful</span> </span> <span> <span> <span> Report abuse </span> </span> </span> <span> <span> <span> </span> </span> </span> <span> Isabela</span> <i> <span> 3.0 out of 5 stars</span> </i> <span> </span> <span> <span> Buen proyector</span> <span> </span> </span> <span> Reviewed in Mexico on July 16, 2020</span> <span> Size: 12.8 x 8.6 x 4.7 inches</span> <i> </i> <span> Verified Purchase</span> <span> <span> Es buen producto, tiene calidad en los materiales y tiene buena proyección de imagen. Esta muy bien que se puede conectar por wi-fi a otro dispositivo. Las letras en los subtitulo no son nítidas pero es un detalle mínimo. El control no trae baterías pero el paquete incluye cable hdmi y auxiliar RCA por si requieren. El audio es aceptable, no lo he probado aun conectándolo a otro altavoz pero no es necesario. Hay que considerar que hay que ver videos con un ambiente oscuro para tener imágenes claras. En fin, me tarde mucho en elegir una buena opción y esta no me decepcionó pero se queda en un rango aceptable, espero que me dure mucho tiempo y en verdad aproveche el producto y su precio.
